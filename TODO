Planet Simulator X
------------------

High fidelity simulator of a planet and its systems including but not limited to:
- Geology / magma / plate tectonics
- Weather
- Asteroid impacts
- Biomes
- Life

Architecture
------------

Two main parts:

1. Visualizer

Lets us explore the planet and what it's generated so far.  It also allows us
to control the engine to do "god" actions, like spawn meteor, etc.  Also, control
time and pausing things.

Visualizer should be decoupled from the engine to allow the engine to run as fast
as possible as performance will likely be a limiting factor

2. Engine

Use scipy and pandas dataframes to do math on a large fixed array of tiles representing
the world, as a large rectangular matrix of tiles, like 5000x2000 tiles, although the
tiles don't have to represent equal area.
